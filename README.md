# Objective: Create an application which can summarize research papers.

##System Prompt: 
The prompt given to the AI in order to run the program.

## Module 1: Intake & Setup
Asks the user for all the informaiton needed to summarize the research paper, such as: the section form the paper and how long the summary should be.

## Module 2: Section Loop
Makes the code more efficient by running a loop to repeat the process of summarizing for the number of sections inputted by the user.

## Module 3: Guardrails
These are the constrains/rules that the program must follow. It ensures that there are less errors and the output is more specific, when running the program.

## Module 4: Rendering & Refinement
These are the requirements for the output of the program. It makes the output look more organized and easy for the user to read and understand.

## Module 5: Easy Citations
This makes the program cite the information it used form the research paper. It makes sure that the user can trust the summary being outputted, because they can see that the summary is only using information from the paper.

## Module 6: Equation Explainer
This module takes equations from the paper and explains it to the user.
